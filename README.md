# **Deep Learning Projects**
This repository contains my implementations and experiments in deep learning. It serves as both a personal learning archive and a demonstration of my growing expertise in the field.

## **Purpose**
The primary goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of core deep learning concepts through hands-on coding. Every notebook and script is written from scratch or adapted with intent â€” no black-box usage without analysis.

## **Contents**
The repository includes:

Core neural network implementations
Experiments with model architectures
Exploratory work on optimization techniques and training strategies
Notes and code from selected deep learning courses

## **Technologies**
*Python
NumPy
PyTorch (and TensorFlow in some cases)
Jupyter Notebooks
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)*
